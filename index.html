<h1> History </h1>

<p>The idea of a national garden in Singapore started in 1822 when Sir Stamford Raffles, 
the founder of modern Singapore and a keen naturalist, 
developed the first ‘Botanical and Experimental Garden’ at Fort Canning. 
It was only in 1859 that the Gardens at its present site was founded and laid out in the English Landscape Movement’s style 
by an Agri-Horticultural society. The Gardens was soon handed over to the British colonial government (in 1874) 
and a series of Kew-trained botanists saw the Gardens blossom into an important botanical institute over the following decades. 

Today, the Gardens is managed by the National Parks Board, a statutory board of the Singapore government.

<h2>National Orchid Garden &#x1F33A</h2>
<p>
<div class="a"> <font size="2" face="verdana" color="black">
The National Orchid Garden, located within the Singapore Botanic Gardens, was opened on 20th October 1995 by Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. 

The Garden is located on the highest hill in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Providing a place for 60,000 orchid plants - consisting of 1000 species and more than 2,000 hybrids - is the three hectares of carefully landscaped slopes.

The design concept presenting the display of plants in four separate color zones: the spring zone with its prevailing colors of bright and lively shades of gold, yellow and creams; the summer zone with its major tones of strong reds and pinks; the autumn zone of matured shades; and the winter zone of whites and cool blues. A careful combination of selected trees, shrubs, herbs and orchids (mostly hybrids) with matching foliage and floral colors depicts the color combination.

<h3>COMO Adventure Grove &#x1F341;</h3>

<p>Inspired by the distinctive parts of trees found within the Gardens, 
this is a modern interpretation of the timeless experience of climbing and playing in trees. 
Children can swing, slide and climb on structures resembling the aerial roots of the Weeping Fig (Ficus benjamina), 
scramble over the warty surface of a giant Cempedak (Artocarpus integer) 
or roll and hop around the pod and seeds of a Saga tree (Adenanthera pavonina).
These adaptive components will help introduce children to nature through play.

The COMO Adventure Grove is set within nature, 
so children can connect with nature through play and exploration. 
It will enable children to choose how and what to play with, 
thus developing a sense of adventure and discovery, and increasing their independence.</p>

<p>Open daily 7am - 7pm</p>
<p style= "color:Tomato;">No dogs allowed</p>
